Privacy Policy — Enterprise WebApp Builder GPT

Effective date: 25 August 2025
Last updated: 25 August 2025

1) Who we are

“Enterprise WebApp Builder GPT” (“Service”, “we”, “our”) is provided by YourCompany Pvt. Ltd. (“Controller”). We help users turn a short objective into a secure web-app plan, docs, GitHub repo setup, and optional deployment on Render.

2) Scope

This policy explains how we handle personal data when you:

Chat with the GPT (prompts, files, settings)

Use Actions (e.g., create docs, create a GitHub repo, deploy on Render)

Visit our websites/hosted policy page

3) What we collect

Chat Content: text you type, files you upload for analysis/doc generation.

Project Metadata: project names, feature lists, tech stack choices, URLs returned by actions.

Account & Auth Data: (only if you connect services) GitHub username/org/repo names; Render service names/IDs.

Operational Logs: timestamps, action names, status codes, error messages, request IDs (no code/secret bodies).

Device/Usage (website only): IP (transient), user-agent, basic analytics.

We do not ask for or store payment details via the GPT.
Secrets (API keys, tokens) are requested only when strictly needed and are stored in secret managers, not in chat history.

4) Sources

You (prompts, files, settings)

Connected services (GitHub, Render) — metadata returned by their APIs

Public web (for competitor feature checks)

5) Purposes & legal bases

Provide the Service (generate plans/docs, integrate repos, deploy): contract necessity.

Security & abuse prevention (rate-limits, audit logs): legitimate interests/legal obligation.

Improvements & quality (anonymized aggregate metrics): legitimate interests.

Consent-based features (optional competitor lookups, marketing opt-in): consent.

6) How we use your data

Generate architecture/tech stack/security plans and PDFs on your request.

Create/initialize GitHub repos and CI/CD files you ask for.

Trigger deployments on Render you ask for.

Run competitor/product lookups on the public web when you ask for it.

Provide troubleshooting and support.

7) Sharing & processors

We use vetted sub-processors to run the Service:

OpenAI (model inference for chats and Actions)

GitHub (if connected by you)

Render (if you deploy)

Cloud hosting/CDN/email providers for our API and document delivery

Error monitoring/logging tools (metadata only)

We do not sell personal data. We disclose data to authorities only if legally required.

8) International transfers

Data may be processed globally. We use safeguards such as SCCs (GDPR) or equivalent transfer mechanisms. DPDP compliance is followed for transfers from India.

9) Security

TLS in transit; encrypted storage for documents and metadata

Secrets in a dedicated secret manager; least-privilege access; key rotation

Audit logging; dependency and vulnerability scanning; periodic reviews

CI/CD hardening; environment isolation; principle of least privilege

Incident response plan and breach notification processes

10) Retention

Generated PDFs & project artifacts: 90 days (default) or as set by you

Action logs/metadata: 180 days (for security/audit)

Chat transcripts: per your ChatGPT account settings; we minimize storing outside OpenAI

Deletion on request: honored unless we must retain for legal reasons

11) Your rights

Subject to law (GDPR/DPDP), you may request:

Access, correction, deletion

Portability (structured, machine-readable)

Restriction or objection to processing

Withdraw consent (for consent-based features)

How: email privacy@yourdomain.com
. For India, you may escalate to the Grievance Officer.

12) Children

Not intended for individuals under 18. We do not knowingly process children’s data.

13) Cookies

Our website may use strictly-necessary and basic analytics cookies. No cross-site ad tracking.

14) Automated decision-making

We use AI to generate content and plans at your direction. We do not make decisions producing legal or similarly significant effects without human involvement.

15) Your responsibilities

Do not upload special categories of personal data (health, biometrics, etc.) unless contractually required and appropriate safeguards are in place.

Remove secrets from prompts; provide tokens only via secure secret fields when requested.

Respect third-party terms (GitHub, Render).

16) Third-party links

Links returned by the GPT (e.g., competitor sites) are outside our control. Review their privacy policies.

17) Changes to this policy

We will update this page and adjust the “Last updated” date. Material changes will be announced in-product or by email where possible.

Short Summary (non-binding)

We use your prompts/files only to provide what you ask (plans, PDFs, repos, deployments). We keep logs briefly for reliability/security, store docs for a limited time, secure everything with encryption and least privilege, don’t sell data, and honor GDPR/DPDP rights.
